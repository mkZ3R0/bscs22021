const excelDescription= `
    This was a univeristy project in my Data Structures And Algorithms course. I developed an excel or google sheets
    replica using a self defined cell that had an up, down, left, and right pointer. Using this as a building, i
    created a linked sheet, where you can insert and delete rows and columns. It also has common mathematical functions
    like maximum, minimum, and average.
