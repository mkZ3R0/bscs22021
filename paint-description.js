    This was a university project in my object-oriented programming course. 
    I developed a paint application using <strong>TKINTER Library</strong> in Python. 
    The application supports all basic paint functionality, allowing different shapes, brushes, 
    save, load, and erase features. The canvas also includes zoom, select, and move functionality for editing.
